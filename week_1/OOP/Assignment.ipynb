    "The code above is an implementation of a car rental system using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define a base class Vehicle that has some common attributes like make, model, year, and weight. We define its constructor \\_\\_init__ to take in these attributes and initialize them. We also define two special methods \\_\\_repr__ and \\_\\_str__ that return a string representation of the object. \\_\\_repr__ is typically used for debugging purposes while \\_\\_str__ is used to return a user-friendly string representation. We also define a @property decorator for the weight attribute, which allows it to be accessed like a property rather than a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define two derived classes Car and Truck that inherit from the Vehicle base class. They each have their own unique attributes and methods, like num_doors for Car and payload_capacity for Truck. They also override the \\_\\_str__ method to include their specific attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Car class has a start method and a stop method, which print out messages indicating that the car has been started or stopped. The Truck class has a load method, which takes in a weight and prints out a message indicating whether the truck can handle the weight or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have a `@classmethod` called from_string that takes in a string representation of a vehicle and returns an instance of the corresponding class. This is a factory method that allows us to create vehicle objects from string representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main program, we create instances of the Car and Truck classes and call their methods to demonstrate their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code demonstrates how OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction can be used to build a modular and extensible system for a car rental company."

    "# E-Library Project Prompt\n",
    "You have been tasked with building an e-library application that allows users to browse, borrow, and return books. The application should be built using object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including private methods, inheritance, polymorphism, property, staticmethod, classmethod, str, repr, and other OOP concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "1. The application should have a Book class that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* title: a string representing the title of the book\n",
    "*author: a string representing the author of the book\n",
    "*ISBN: a unique identifier for the book\n",
    "*available_copies: an integer representing the number of available copies of the book\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 The Book class should have private methods for updating the number of available copies of the book when it is borrowed or returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The application should have a Library class that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* books: a list of all the books in the library\n",
    "* members: a list of all the members registered with the library\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 The Library class should have methods for adding and removing books from the library, as well as for registering and unregistering members with the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 The Library class should have a search_books method that takes in a search query and returns a list of books that match the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The application should have a Member class that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name: a string representing the name of the member\n",
    "* email: a string representing the email address of the member\n",
    "*borrowed_books: a list of books currently borrowed by the member\n",
    "*The Member class should have methods for borrowing and returning books.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The application should have a Transaction class that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "*book: the book being borrowed or returned\n",
    "*member: the member borrowing or returning the book\n",
    "*timestamp: the timestamp of the transaction\n",
    "4.1 The Transaction class should have a static method for creating a new transaction object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 The Book, Library, Member, and Transaction classes should all implement the \\_\\_str__ and \\_\\_repr__ methods for displaying their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus Requirements\n",
    "1. Implement inheritance in the Book class to create separate classes for different types of books (e.g. fiction, non-fiction, textbooks) that have additional properties and methods specific to their type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement polymorphism in the Transaction class to handle both borrowing and returning of books.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement a property in the Book class that calculates the percentage of available copies remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a class method in the Transaction class that returns a list of all transactions that occurred within a specified date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables\n",
    "1. A Python project that includes all the necessary classes and methods described in the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A README file that includes instructions for running the application and any other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unit tests for each class and method in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "1. The project meets all the requirements described in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The project utilizes object-oriented programming concepts effectively, including private methods, inheritance, polymorphism, property, staticmethod, classmethod, str, repr, and other OOP concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code is well-organized, readable, and follows PEP 8 guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The project includes thorough unit tests that cover the given criteria"
